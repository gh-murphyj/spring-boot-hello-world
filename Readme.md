# Introduction

This was just an exercise in creating a Spring MVC application using Spring Boot in IntelliJ IDEA. I took https://patrickgrimard.io/2014/08/14/how-to-build-a-spring-boot-application-using-intellij-idea/ as my source. Couldn't follow that example exactly as the Spring Boot pluging is not in the Community edition. However, it was simple enough to create the project by doing the following:

1. Go to https://start.spring.io/ and create the project with Group and Artifact as com.patrickgrimard and spring-boot-hello-world and adding Web as a dependency.
2. After downloading and unzipping the created project, simply use File->Open in IDEA to open the project as an IDEA project.
